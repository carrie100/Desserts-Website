           <p>This was delicious and almost tasted better than the real thing! I added graham cracker crumbs to the peanut butter mixture for a crunch to make it taste more like Reese’s and it improved it SO MUCH! Everyone should try this</p>

          <p>Overall very good. They were a little crumbly so I recommend using powdered sugar. Definitely going to become a regular in my house. A real winner.</p></td>
