  <!--List of Substitutions that can be made-->

  <h2>Whole Wheat Flour instead of White Flour</h2>
   <p>The extra fiber helps aid in digestion and has been shown to lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, etc. Whole wheat flour is denser than white flour, so small recipe adjustments may be needed to ensure a moist finished product instead of a dry and hard texture.
   This substitution works best with practically any type of baking! Breads, cookies, brownies, etc.</p>
   <p> (1 cup of white flour for ~¾ cup of wheat flour)</p>
  <h2>Natural Honey, Maple Syrup, Coconut Sugar or Ripened Bananas instead of Sugar</h2>
   <p>These natural sources of sugar are less likely to spike your blood sugar like table sugar and are more easily metabolized in the body. A lot of these are naturally sweeter than table sugar, so you may be able to use less in your recipes! Try a combination of the two to get the best of both worlds.</p>
  <h2>Applesauce instead of Oil/Butter</h2>
   <p>Most unsweetened applesauce contains only 80-100 calories per cup and 2-3 grams of fiber. Table sugar can contain up to 700 calories per cup with 0 grams of fiber! Making this swap can save you from gaining unnecessary weight when indulging in a baked good.
      Applesauce has a high percent of water content, so it is important to reduce the overall amount of liquid in your original recipe by 2-3 tablespoons. If you still crave that sugary taste, try to gradually add in more applesauce with each batch until you’ve eliminated half the original sugar content.
      This substitution can work with anything, but I recommend trying it in your cookies and sweet breads.</p>
   <h2>Marshmallow Fluff or Ganache instead of Frosting</h2>
    <p>Why sacrifice flavor when counting calories? Are you a cupcake connoisseur who dreads thinking of how most of the calories are coming from that mound of butter and sugar on top? I’m here to tell you that you can still enjoy that mound of flavor for half the calories! Sure, chocolate ganache on a cupcake doesn’t look the same as frosting, but a lot of people actually prefer the taste of ganache to frosting…</p>
   <h2>Dark Chocolate instead of White Chocolate</h2>
    <p>We all love chocolate. Even the people who say, “I’m not a chocolate person” are just lying to you in attempt to trick themselves out of another inevitable chocolate binge. Guess what, you can have a chocolate with proven nutritional benefits instead of something that we all know goes straight to our hips (or so it seems). Dark chocolate is rich with antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, and has been proven to help lower blood pressure…the darker the better!</p>
